<h2>Profile</h2>
<p>Hello! My name is Tijana and I am an experienced Marketing Professional with a first-class degree
in Psychology. My biggest achievement during my time at university was publishing my first scientific 
paper based on a pilot study focusing on adapting a digital mental health assessment tool for use in low and 
middle-income countries in SE Europe. <br />
My marketing experience to date includes working at a start-up media agency as an intern, where I worked on multiple
clients covering many different categories, as well as working at one of the world's biggest agency groups, Publicis Groupe,
where I worked on Haleon's (former GSK) consumer health brands. During my time at Publicis, I was lucky to have worked 
with many big names such as Spotify, Twitch and Meta. <br />
Before I was a Psychology studient, I was a merit-based full-ride scholarship holder, which allowed me to spend a year in the U.S. on 
a cultural exchange when I was only 16 years old. I have also displayed my interest in different cultures and bulding a better and more
inclusive future by participating in Challenge History project focusing on understanding conflict in the Western Balkans, as well as 
participating in Belgrade International MUN conference as a delegate on two occasions.

<h2>Education</h2>
<h3>York St John University</h3>
<h3>BSc Psychology (hons) </h3>
<h4>2018 - 2021</h4>
<h4>Grade: 1st</h4>
<p>
    <Ul>
        <li>Throughout my degree, I mostly focused on Social and Clinical Psychology. This helped me build an understanding 
            on how we function as humans between ourselves in society, as well as what the underlining reasons for our 
            behaviour are.  
        </li>
        <li>My degree allowed me to gain both qualitative and quantitative research experience. In my Quantitative Research Methods 
            module, I learned how to use SPSS Statistics for data analytics, while my Qualitative Research Methods module gave me 
            invaluable interviewing experience. Both of these modules also helped me learn how to build surveys for the 
            purposes of research in Qualtrics.
        </li>
        <li>During my time at university, I volunteered as an academic representative. This role included collecting feedback from 
            peers in a form of survey to share with our senior lecturers with a goal of improving student experience. 
        </li>
        <li>As a Peer-Assisted Study Sessions (PASS) leader, being promoted to a Senior PASS leader position in my third year, I 
            organised and facilitated study sessions for first-year Psychology students bi-weekly in my 2nd and 3rd year.
        </li>
        <li>Other volunteering experience during my degree includes volunteering as a youth mentor at The Island, a local 
            charity in York. My time at this charity was cut short due to Covid lockdown. <br /> 
            After the lockdown has started, I started volunteering virtually at another local charity called Converge, a charity 
            helping adults using mental health services. I assissted in organising weekly film workshops, the goal of which was to teach 
            the participants how to make short films.
